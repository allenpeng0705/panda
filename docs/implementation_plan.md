# Panda: Implementation Plan

This document is the **step-by-step execution plan** for building Panda as a self-contained, high-performance AI gateway. Work follows a **Plan → Implement → Review → Refine** cycle within each phase.

**Why Rust:** The shipping artifact is a single **copy-and-run** static binary—no Python runtimes, no embedded Lua VM, and minimal operational surface area compared with traditional API gateways.

The [high-level design](./high_level_design.md) describes *what* Panda is; this document describes *how* we build it in order.

---

## Alignment with the “enterprise AI gateway” bar

This plan matches the **Kong-style lesson** you care about: a **thin, native data plane** on the hot path (fast intercept, stream-safe forward, hooks for policy), with a **separate, long-term control plane story** implied by GitOps config—not a fat database inside every replica.

**Already explicit:** OpenAI-style ingress, real-time SSE, Wasm extensibility (vs Lua), JWT + TPM, PII scrubbing path, intent routing + MCP, OTel + K8s hardening.

**Cargo from discussions, tracked in phases below:** **universal adapter** (one client contract → many provider schemas), **semantic cache** (embedding + vector lookup—not URL key cache), **circuit breaking / failover** between upstreams, optional **context-enrichment** middleware (gateway-side RAG), and **proof-of-intent** gates on dangerous tool calls (see Phase 4).

**High concurrency:** Throughput scales with **horizontal replicas** behind an L4/L7 load balancer; each instance must keep **per-connection memory flat** on long SSE. Phase 1/5 numbers below are **quality gates**, not product ceilings—document baseline hardware when reporting.

---

## Phase 1: Foundations — the core proxy (“Panda Heart”)

**Goal:** A high-performance HTTP/1.1 + **HTTP/2**-ready streaming proxy that can sit **behind Kong** (upstream from the edge gateway) or run **standalone** for LLM chat streaming. Initial MVP targets **OpenAI-compatible** Chat Completions; adapter-style transforms expand in Phase 4.

**Milestone structure:**

| Step | Name | Intent |
|------|------|--------|
| **1.1** | Workspace | Modular crate layout: **proxy engine** decoupled from **config loader** so each is unit-testable without the other. |
| **1.2** | Streaming hot-path | Tokio + Hyper service loop proving **low overhead** on proxied SSE (TTFT target in Review). |
| **1.3** | Kong handshake | Middleware for **trusted gateway headers** so when Kong (or another edge) already authenticated the caller, Panda extracts **subject / tenant** and **scopes** for immediate **TPM accounting keys** and audit context (full JWT validation remains Phase 3). |

### Plan

- Initialize the Rust **workspace** with **Tokio** (async) and **Hyper** (HTTP); keep **config types + file loading** in a dedicated module or crate consumed by the server binary.
- Define a minimal configuration structure (YAML or JSON) for upstream LLM endpoints (URL, timeouts, optional **priority / failover group** for later circuit breaking).
- Specify **request passthrough** for Chat Completions: preserve semantics the backend expects.
- Specify **trusted ingress** configuration: optional **mTLS** or **shared secret** (e.g. network policy) for the Kong → Panda hop; **header allowlist** mapping to internal identity (see Implement).

### Implement

**1.1 — Workspace** *(implemented in repo)*

- Crate boundaries: **`panda-config`** (parse + validate), **`panda-proxy`** (Tokio/Hyper listener + future forwarder), **`panda-server`** binary crate producing the **`panda`** executable.
- Tests: invalid config in `panda-config`; optional proxy tests with mock upstream **without** binding a real port where possible.
- Run locally: `cp panda.example.yaml panda.yaml` then `cargo run -p panda-server` (or `cargo build -p panda-server` → `target/debug/panda`).

**1.2 — Streaming hot-path** *(core reverse proxy implemented)*

- Listener + **Hyper HTTP/1 client** (`hyper-util` legacy client + **`hyper-rustls`** with **ring** + Mozilla roots): forward **any** path (except `/health` and `/ready`) to `upstream` + client path/query.
- Request/response bodies use **`UnsyncBoxBody`** so bytes **stream through** (SSE-friendly; no full-response buffer in Panda).
- Hop-by-hop header filtering; strip upstream **`content-length`** on the way back so Hyper can re-frame chunked streams safely.
- **Still to do for full Phase 1 review:** explicit **max body / stream** limits, **retry / circuit breaker** groups from config, and measured TTFT benchmarks.

### Kong handshake (milestone 1.3) *(complete for Phase 1)*

- **`trusted_gateway` in YAML** (optional): `attestation_header`, `subject_header`, `tenant_header`, `scopes_header`.
- **Env `PANDA_TRUSTED_GATEWAY_SECRET`**: attestation header value is compared with **HMAC-SHA256(secret, ·) digests** + **`constant_time_eq`** (same-length digest compare; avoids naive string timing leaks). Identity headers stripped when not trusted; attestation never forwarded upstream.
- **`observability.correlation_header`** (default `x-request-id`): reuse incoming id, else **W3C `traceparent`**, else UUID; echoed on the **response**; included in stderr logs.
- **TPM**: in-memory prompt (`Content-Length / 4`) and **completion** (SSE: **tiktoken** `cl100k_base` on `delta.content`, or `usage.completion_tokens` when present); optional **Redis** via `tpm.redis_url` or **`PANDA_REDIS_URL`** (`INCRBY` on `panda:tpm:v1:prompt:*` / `completion:*`).
- **TLS / mTLS**: optional **`tls`** block (`cert_pem`, `key_pem`, optional **`client_ca_pem`**) — Panda listens with **HTTPS** on the same `listen` address; plaintext HTTP path disabled when TLS is configured.
- **Still to do later:** scope-based enforcement, richer audit export, sliding-window TPM policies.
- Kong pattern: terminate OIDC at Kong, set attestation + identity headers, forward to Panda (see [integration & evolution](./integration_and_evolution.md)).

### Review

- Does the proxy sustain **~1,000 concurrent** streams per instance **on a defined baseline machine** without degradation (tail latency, error rate)?
- Is **time to first token (TTFT)** overhead from the gateway **under ~2 ms** in a controlled lab setup? (Tune baselines per hardware; treat this as a target, not a guarantee.)
- **Kong handshake:** With trust configured, does a request **without** a valid edge hop **not** inherit privileged identity? With trust + injected headers, do TPM counters attribute to the **correct** subject?

### Refine

- Profile allocations; prefer **`Bytes`** / shared buffers for bodies and SSE chunks where it measurably helps.

---

## Phase 2: Plugin engine — the Wasm sandbox

**Goal:** Extensibility via **Rust / Go (TinyGo)** plugins **without** recompiling the main binary.

### Plan

- Integrate **Wasmtime** (or a similarly mature embedded Wasm runtime) as the plugin VM.
- Define the **host ↔ plugin ABI:** what the plugin receives (headers, body chunks, request context) and what it may return (mutations, early reject, metrics tags).

### Implement

- **Workspace crate `panda-wasm`:** `PANDA_WASM_ABI_VERSION`, **Wasmtime** loader, `plugins.directory` in config; loads `*.wasm` at startup and runs an optional `add` smoke export per module.
- **`panda-proxy`:** loads plugins when `plugins.directory` is set; keeps `Arc<PluginRuntime>` for upcoming per-request hooks.
- **Sample Rust guest (`wasm-plugin-sample`):** minimal `panda_abi_version` + `add` for smoke tests; build with `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
- **ABI spec doc:** `docs/wasm_abi.md` now defines v0 exports/imports, return codes, limits, and compatibility.
- **TinyGo sample skeleton:** `samples/tinygo-plugin/` added for cross-toolchain parity and rollout validation.
- **Next:** trap isolation hardening per request, TinyGo build matrix validation, optional hot reload.

### Review

- Misbehaving or trapping plugins **must not** crash the gateway process; isolate failures per invocation and surface structured errors.
- **Status semantics (implemented):**
  - plugin policy reject (`panda_on_request*` non-zero return code) -> **HTTP 403** when `plugins.fail_closed=true`
  - runtime/trap/timeout/join failures -> **HTTP 502** when `plugins.fail_closed=true`
  - fail-open mode (`plugins.fail_closed=false`) logs and continues
- **Return-code contract (v0):** `0=allow`, `1=policy denied`, `2=malformed request`, other non-zero values are plugin-specific rejects.
- **Hot reload (implemented):** optional `plugins.hot_reload` with interval `plugins.reload_interval_ms`; runtime swaps atomically on directory fingerprint changes and keeps serving with last-good runtime when reload fails.
- **Observability counters (implemented):** in-process per-plugin/per-hook counters for allow/reject/runtime/timeout outcomes.

### Refine

- Add metric export surface (Prometheus / OTel) for plugin counters and reason codes.

---

## Phase 3: Identity & security — the bouncer

**Goal:** Answer **who is calling** and reduce **enterprise data** leakage risk on the hot path.

### Plan

- JWT validation middleware (**OIDC-compatible** issuers: Okta, Azure AD, etc.).
- **Token exchange:** map a **user token → scoped agent token** with tight tool/route claims.

### Implement

- **JWT middleware (Phase 3 entry):** optional bearer auth with HS256 secret env and claim checks (`iss`/`aud`/required `scope`) from config.
- **PII scrubber:** regex-based first; evolve toward NER or hybrid detection when Phase 4+ depth lands.
- **Token-based rate limiting** (TPM / token budgets): start with **in-memory** per-instance counters; design boundaries so **Redis** (or similar) can back **global** counts later.

### Review

- Can we block or flag prompts that match **jailbreak / injection** heuristics (starter rules before full ML)?

### Refine

- Multi-pattern matching at scale: **Aho–Corasick** (e.g. via the `aho-corasick` crate) for many fixed-string / pattern scans.

---

## Phase 4: Intelligence & MCP — the agentic brain

**Goal:** Move beyond dumb proxying to a **tool-aware** gateway with **cost-aware** reuse and **multi-vendor** egress.

### Plan

- Embed an **MCP host client** in the binary.
- Add a **semantic router** using a **small ONNX** model (e.g. sentence embedding + k-NN routes, or a tiny classifier—`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` class of model is a reasonable starting point).
- **Semantic cache:** normalize prompt (+ optional fingerprint of system/tools), embed with a **fast local** model, query **Redis / Milvus / other** vector index for similarity ≥ configured threshold; on hit, return cached completion (skip upstream). Keeps **store pluggable**—the gateway owns the policy and keying, not necessarily the database binary.
- **Universal adapter:** map **one** stable inbound API (OpenAI-compatible) to **backend-specific** JSON for Anthropic, Gemini, local llama.cpp servers, etc., so clients swap models without code changes.

### Implement

- Connect to at least one MCP server locally (e.g. SQLite or filesystem demo server).
- Surface discovered tools to the LLM through the **`/v1/chat/completions` tools** field (or equivalent for your chosen API compatibility layer).
- Optional **context enrichment** middleware: gateway performs retrieval (vector search against corp KB), **injects** snippets into the prompt or messages, then forwards—keeps application clients thin (same pattern as “RAG at the edge”).

### Review

- End-to-end: **LLM invokes an MCP tool** through Panda and the result flows back correctly.
- **Proof of intent (MVP):** block or audit tool calls that are **inconsistent** with routed intent / user prompt class (starter rules before full ML)—aligns with [HLD proof-of-intent](./high_level_design.md#42-proof-of-intent-agentic-security-model).

### Refine

- **Tool discovery:** send only **intent-relevant** tools to the model to save context window and reduce misuse surface.

---

## Phase 5: Production & scale — enterprise finish

**Goal:** Deployment is **boring**; failure modes are **bounded** and observable.

### Plan

- **OpenTelemetry** for traces and metrics (HTTP, upstream latency, TTFT, stream duration, plugin time, TPM).
- **Packaging:** Docker image wrapping the **single static binary**; reproducible builds.

### Implement

- Kubernetes **Deployment** + **ConfigMap** (and Secrets) templates; document upgrade and rollback; **PodDisruptionBudget** / **HPA** hooks as needed for **many replicas** at egress.
- **Health endpoints:** `/health` (process up) and `/ready` (config loaded, critical deps reachable—define criteria explicitly).

### Review

- Load test at scale (e.g. **~5,000** concurrent streams **aggregate** or per shard, per environment—state the topology); watch CPU, RSS, and tail latency; validate no systematic memory growth on long-lived SSE.
- **Soak test:** run **≥ 24 hours** of steady **SSE** traffic (mix of short and long streams) and confirm **no creep** in RSS, open sockets, or in-flight task counts; catch slow leaks that burst tests miss.
- Revisit **Phase 1** SLOs under load: TTFT overhead, p99 stream stall time, upstream failover correctness.

### Refine

- Allocator tuning (**mimalloc** / **jemalloc**) if fragmentation shows up under long-lived AI streams; validate with benchmarks before committing.

## Deployment complexity (illustrative)

| Aspect | Phase 1–2 (MVP) | Phase 5 (enterprise) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Binary size** | ~15 MB order of magnitude | ~45 MB order of magnitude (Wasm + ONNX / models bundled or mounted) |
| **Runtime dependencies** | None required at OS level beyond libc | Optional **Redis** (or equivalent) for **global** TPM / shared limits |
| **Deployment** | Copy binary, run `./panda` | `kubectl apply -f` on maintained manifests (e.g. `k8s/` or Helm) |

Sizes are **targets** until measured on the release pipeline; track them in CI.

---

## Mapping to the conceptual layers

| Implementation phase | Primary HLD layers |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| Phase 1 | Ingress + Egress (minimal) |
| Phase 2 | Cross-cutting (extensibility) |
| Phase 3 | Shield (+ Ingress hooks) |
| Phase 4 | Brain + MCP aggregation |
| Phase 5 | Operations, observability, packaging |

This plan can be revised as benchmarks and security reviews land; keep the **Plan → Implement → Review → Refine** loop explicit in PRs and milestones.

## Enterprise final targets (north star)

The phases above deliver a **credible MVP through production-ready core**. For **final** enterprise positioning—competing with mature API gateways on operability and trust—track the items below (not all need to ship on day one; prioritize by tenant and industry).

### Reliability and performance

- Published **SLOs** (e.g. availability, p99 TTFT add-on, p99 time-to-last-token under load) and **error budgets**; dashboards that match those SLOs.
- **Graceful shutdown:** stop accepting new streams, **drain** in-flight SSE within a bounded window, then exit—required for Kubernetes rollouts without client resets.
- **Explicit limits:** max concurrent streams per instance, per-tenant, and per-key; **fair queuing** or backoff when saturated (avoid retry storms).
- **Capacity planning:** document scaling curves (streams vs CPU vs RAM); optional **chaos** or fault-injection drills for upstream blackout and slowloris-style clients.

### Security and compliance

- **Threat model** doc (see HLD document map): injection, tool abuse, **cache poisoning** (semantic cache), scope elevation, plugin escape hardening.
- **Secrets:** upstream API keys and OIDC client secrets from env / Vault / K8s Secrets only; never echo in logs or traces without redaction policy.
- **mTLS** (optional) gateway ↔ sensitive upstreams; **plugin supply chain:** signed Wasm, allowlisted digests, ABI version pinning.
- **Audit trail:** structured, **intent- and tool-centric** events (who, which agent, which tool, allow/deny/synthetic cache hit); retention and **SIEM** export; policy for **PII in audit logs**.
- **Compliance hooks:** tenant **data residency** flags, semantic-cache **TTL/eviction** and “forget” semantics where regulations require it; DPIA-friendly description of what leaves the network.

### Multi-tenancy and governance

- **Strong tenant isolation** in config and quotas (routes, backends, TPM, tool allowlists); optional separate upstream credentials per tenant.
- **Config validation** at load: invalid config **fails closed** or blocks `/ready`; schema versioning for GitOps.
- **Admin vs data plane:** any future **management API** must be authenticated, authorized, **rate-limited**, and separate from customer-facing ingress where possible.

### Protocol and integration completeness

- **gRPC** ingress/egress (per HLD) when REST-only is no longer enough for internal services.
- **Webhooks / eventing** (optional): async notify on policy violations or spend thresholds for finance/SOC workflows.

### Operational excellence

- **Runbooks:** upstream down, cache poisoned, JWT clock skew, OOM during soak, Wasm trap storms.
- **Release safety:** canary or progressive rollout story; **versioned** config migration notes.
- **SBOM** and dependency audit in CI; **signed** container images (cosign or equivalent).

Treat this section as the **backlog umbrella** for “enterprise finish” after Phase 5; fold items into phased work as customers demand them.
